## Neo-Mathematics Foundation

John Baez has raised important inquiries regarding the necessity of a coherent mathematical framework for the Standard Model, advocating for an exploration based on "logical principles." This discussion resonates with the challenges he previously tackled in *Struggles with the Continuum*, particularly the dilemma surrounding the concept of infinity in modern mathematics. This notion has been substantially influenced by David Hilbert's philosophy of abstraction, which contrasts with the constructive mathematics promoted by L.E.J. Brouwer.

In a related area, John H. Conway and Kent D. Boklan have presented compelling evidence suggesting that all Fermat primes were already known to Fermat himself, emphasizing that only five such primes have been identified to date. Their work supports the idea that these primes were not merely a product of modern discoveries but rather a recognition of knowledge existing in Fermat's time. This raises further questions about the recognition of infinity in mathematics: Why do we limit our understanding to infinity when the finite aspects of fundamental mathematical results might not align with the infinite concepts we attempt to conceive? Such limitations could adversely affect our ability to grasp the intricacies of mathematics grounded in finite means.

We propose to term this perspective the **Fermat-Revealed Thesis**, attributing this exploration not only to the historical implications brought forth by Conway and Boklan but also to the broader discourse on mathematical knowledge and discovery. This examination aligns with contemporary mathematical and physical frameworks under the **Principle of Rationality in Physics**.

Fundamental physics relies on concepts that effectively encapsulate causality in a flexible manner, encompassing both fixed and dynamic causal structures. Sets are commonly employed in physics to organize and categorize objects or properties, with the notion of sets as elements of other sets being particularly significant. This principle allows for the delineation of relationships among various physical elements, which is essential for analyzing complex systems.

In pursuing advancements in fundamental physics, we must reevaluate our mathematical foundations and strive to develop elegant principles that enhance our understanding of the universe. This foundational work shapes our comprehension of the natural world, articulating physical systems characterized by specific degrees of freedom, represented by natural numbers that resonate with human cognition. This numerical framework is crucial for our interpretation of the world, with our human senses serving as vital instruments for engaging with the underlying physics of our environment.

### Physical Systems with Natural Numbers of Degrees of Freedom

Recognizing that each physical system possesses a finite number of degrees of freedom is essential for accurately describing its state and properties. The interactions and behaviors of these systems are significantly influenced by the specific order and arrangement of their degrees of freedom. This highlights the importance of considering the ordering within the power sets of various physical systems to enhance our reasoning and understanding of their behavior and interactions at different complexity levels.

### Relationship Between Power Sets

The relationship between the power sets of physical systems with differing degrees of freedom is a fundamental characteristic derived from set theory. Specifically, the power set of a physical system \( S_n \) with \( n \) degrees of freedom is a subset of the power set of a physical system \( S_{n+1} \) with \( n + 1 \) degrees of freedom.

To effectively represent a physical system \( S_{n+1} \) with \( n + 1 \) degrees of freedom, we can generate the power set of an ordered set recursively, adhering to the established order of the elements within that set. This can be expressed as:

\[ 
P(S_{n+1}) \equiv P(S_n) \cup P_c(S_n) 
\]

where \( P_c(S_n) \) denotes the complement of the power set \( P(S_n) \), containing all elements not in \( P(S_n) \) of the set \( S_n \) with \( n \) degrees of freedom. This equation is analogous to decomposing a group into a subgroup and its complement within a larger group, emphasizing the concept of breaking down a group into its constituent parts for a deeper understanding of the group structure and its relationships with subgroups and complements.

In Section 5.2, we demonstrate that \( P(S_n) \) is a finite Abelian group, implying that \( P_c(S_n) \) is never a group. Therefore, we can express:

\[
P(S_1) \subset P(S_2) \subset P(S_3) \subset \ldots \subset P(S_n) \subset P(S_{n+1}) 
\]

Consequently,

\[
2^1 < 2^2 < 2^3 < \ldots < 2^n < 2^{n+1}
\]

We explore the **Fermat-Revealed Thesis**, honoring the contributions of John H. Conway and Kent D. Boklan, within this framework of **Neo-Mathematics**. In this framework, sets are defined by consecutive integers from 1 to \( n \). We assume that the transition from \( n \) to \( n + 1 \) is mathematically well-defined by construction, without necessitating the concept of infinity. Our framework for this Neo-Mathematics is grounded in the critiques presented in our work, *A Comprehensive Modern Mathematical Foundation for Hypercomplex Numbers*, which can be accessed [here](https://efaysal.github.io/HCNFEK2024FE/HypComNumSetTheGCFEKFEB2024.pdf).
